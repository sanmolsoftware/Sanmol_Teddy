<p class="p1">Your privacy is taken seriously on ULTA.com websites. Your understanding and compliance with our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") will help us provide you with an efficient and satisfying shopping experience. Our Privacy Policy covers any personal information that ULTA obtains from you when you use the services provided on ULTA.com websites, including but not limited to www.ulta.com and any other websites owned or operated by ULTA Salon, Cosmetics &amp; Fragrance, Inc.</p>
<p class="p1">By using the services provided on ULTA.com websites, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy, including our use of information that is collected or submitted as described in our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so we encourage you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes.</p>

<p class="p1">1. INFORMATION COLLECTION</p>
<p class="p1">ULTA.com websites collect information about website visitors to provide and improve our services, communicate offers which we believe will interest site visitors, and to administer our business.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p class="p1">We may ask you to provide personally identifiable information to us voluntarily. For example, when you place an order with ULTA.com, we may ask for your e-mail address, the mailing address(es) and phone number(s) of the shipping destination, your billing address, your credit card number, and your credit card expiration date. Collecting this information allows us to complete your order efficiently, to notify you of your order status, and provide personalized interaction. We also may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, such as birthday information, product commentary, and/or information about your experience with our customer service department, to us on a voluntary basis. If we ask for such personally identifiable information from you, we will either tell you how we will use the information or we will use it in conformity with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p class="p1">We may collect and use non-personally-identifiable information from you. Like most major websites, we use "cookies" to collect non-personally-identifiable information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, and the specific ULTA.com website pages that you visit. Additional information about cookies is provided below.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Cookies</p>
<p class="p1">Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our websites and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit an ULTA.com website. By using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience at an ULTA.com website better. To search our websites and/or place an order on ULTA.com, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on. Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookies by deleting them, blocking them, or alerting you when a cookie file is stored. Please review your browser's instructions on these functions.

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Advertising Networks</p>
<p class="p1">From time to time, we may use one or more third-party online advertising networks to serve ads on our behalf on the Internet. The third-party network may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our ads. For example, it may keep track of how many of our ads you saw before visiting our website. This is primarily accomplished using technology such as cookies, action tags, web beacons, and/or GIF tags which are placed in various places within our website. From time to time, we may share anonymous information with third-party network(s) in an aggregate form to help us analyze and improve our website. The third-party network may use information about your visit to our website and other websites in order to provide ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or the process of opting out of online advertising networks, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Children Under 13 Years of Age</p>
<p class="p1">ULTA.com websites are directed to adults, and do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13. If you are a child under the age of 13, you must have your parent's or guardian's consent, and provide that consent to the ULTA.com website, using the contact information provided below, before you provide any information on an ULTA.com website. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you believe your child has provided personal information to an ULTA.com website that you would like us to delete, please Contact Us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">2. INFORMATION USE</p>
<p class="p1">The information we collect on ULTA.com websites may be used to fulfill your requests (such as product orders and responses to email questions) and to communicate with you about or product offers and promotions. When you create an account with us, we offer the opportunity to become a member of ULTA's Loyalty Program, so you may receive future discounts, gifts and ULTA.com e-mail. You can also sign up for e-mail by providing your e-mail address through our site services or our affiliated retail stores.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">3. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE</p>
<p class="p1">We may disclose the information we collect about you (including personally identifiable information) to third parties to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or governmental requests. We may also disclose such information to verify or enforce compliance with our User Agreement and Privacy Policy, to process and fill your order, reduce credit risk, protect against fraud, protect against misuse or unauthorized use of an ULTA.com website, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires such disclosure. We may also disclose such information to a successor entity in connection with a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change affecting the ULTA.com websites.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">4. INFORMATION SHARING</p>
<p class="p1">We may share the information collected at ULTA.com websites with agents or contractors who provide support for our internal operations. Such entities may receive personally identifiable information to allow them to perform their duties, but they may not use that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="p1">In some instances, we may share non-identifying and aggregate information collected on ULTA.com websites with third parties. If you do not want us to share the non-identifying and aggregate information we collect, please Contact Us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">5. SECURING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p class="p1">ULTA.com websites work to protect your personal information and credit card detail when you shop with us online. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology - the industry standard - to encrypt the personal information and credit card detail you provide during the order process.</p>
<p class="p1">To ensure the security of your personal information, you should always provide that information over a secure connection. You can check the existence of a secure connection in one of two ways:</p>
<p class="p1">(1) Look at the URL in your web browser. Whenever you are connected to a secure server, that connection will be represented in the URL as "https," rather than "http."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">(2) Look at your web browser. You know you have an SSL connection if you see a closed lock in Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above) or AOL (AOL 3.0 and above).</p>
<p class="p1">We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your ULTA.com website password(s) with anyone or in any unsolicited phone call or e-mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">While ULTA.com websites strive to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, ULTA.com websites cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">6. PUBLIC FORUMS</p>
<p class="p1">Please remember that any information you may disclose in public areas of our websites or the Internet becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">7. CONTACTING US</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">8. OPTING OUT</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
