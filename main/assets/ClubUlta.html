<p class="p1">The Club at ULTA rewards program is our way of thanking our loyal customers for choosing ULTA. As a member, you'll be rewarded with exclusive offers sent to you via email or catalogs. The program is free; simply shop like you always do - and get rewarded for it. Pretty amazing.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The ABCs of earning gifts</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Shop for what you love, and earn free gifts. You'll get a fabulous rewards certificate from ULTA every quarter based on your spending. You'll earn a certificate level for every $50 spent on beauty. The more you spend, the higher your certificate level will be. Once ULTA serves up your certificate, you have six weeks to redeem it in-store for beauty products from our menu of rewards items. Pretty fabulous. </p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>

<p class="p2">The 123s of redeeming gifts</p>

<p class="p1">Receive free beauty products or salon services. Bring in your Reward Certificate (found on the front cover of your ULTA catalog) and choose one item from the corresponding levels listed in the rewards insert from your ULTA catalog. Members with Level 7 and above are able to redeem in any combination equal to their Reward Certificate Level. </p>
