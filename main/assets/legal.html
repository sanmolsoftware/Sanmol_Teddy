<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1">ULTA.com sells products from many of the finest cosmetic and fragrance producers in the world.

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">ULTA.com will endeavor to provide to Customers all required product labeling information; however, ULTA.com is not the manufacturer of the Beauty Products, therefore it is not responsible for any reaction or any failure of a product to satisfy any special use requirements or otherwise meet the needs or expectations of the Customer.

Since ULTA.com is not the manufacturer of the products it sells, ULTA.com does not accept any liability for the failure of products it sells to meet any specific needs of a user of the product or for any loss, damage or injury caused by such products. ULTA.com will, upon request, endeavor to identify the manufacturer of the product and provide to the Customer contact information for the manufacturer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
