<p class="p1">Our Company</p>
<p class="p1">We were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through distinct channelsódepartment stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products, and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. After extensive research, we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how a woman wanted to shop for beauty products, which led to what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
