	</p>
	<p class="p2">We may disclose the information we collect about you
		(including personally identifiable information) to third parties to
		comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or governmental
		requests. We may also disclose such information to verify or enforce
		compliance with our User Agreement and Privacy Policy, to process and

		<span class="s1">5. SECURING YOUR INFORMATION</span>
	</p>
	<p class="p2">ULTA.com websites work to protect your personal
		information and credit card detail when you shop with us online. We
		use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology - the industry standard - to
		encrypt the personal information and credit card detail you provide
		during the order process.</p>
	<p class="p2">To ensure the security of your personal information,
		you should always provide that information over a secure connection.
		You can check the existence of a secure connection in one of two ways:</p>
	<p class="p2">
		    (1) Look at the URL in your web browser. Whenever you are
		connected to a secure server, that connection will be represented in
		the URL as "https," rather than "http."<span
			class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
	</p>
	<p class="p2">    (2) Look at your web browser. You know you have
		an SSL connection if you see a closed lock in Microsoft Internet
		Explorer (version 3.0 and above) or AOL (AOL 3.0 and above).</p>
	<p class="p3">
		<br>
	</p>
	<p class="p2">
		We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not
		share your ULTA.com website password(s) with anyone or in any
		unsolicited phone call or e-mail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
	</p>
	<p class="p2">
		While ULTA.com websites strive to ensure the integrity and security of
		our network and systems, ULTA.com websites cannot guarantee that our
		security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally
		obtaining this information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

		<br>
	</p>
	<p class="p5">
		<span class="s1">6. PUBLIC FORUMS</span>
	</p>
	<p class="p2">Please remember that any information you may disclose
		in public areas of our websites or the Internet becomes public
		information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose
		personal information in these public areas.</p>
